# 2020 Chicago Marathon Virtual Run Log

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/241cfae8-b495-478f-b166-4d1425744a54/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/run-log/deploys)

The goal is to document my runs and maybe visualize them. The audience is probably for friends and family.

It'll be fun to experiment with gatsby. I want this site to be Chicago Marathon-themed. Also it should be fun and fast. I'm expecting this to be mostly text. Would be fun to automate run routes and notes.
