description: Minor Hiccup On Thursday Though
week: 7

Running faster felt amazing on Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday. Like, 9'45" pace seems to be a cut-off for me of maintaining good form and having fun. Interestingly, I haven't had knee pain like in earlier weeks running faster. I feel like it may just be muscle memory at faster speeds.

While I did have fun, I'm going to start setting target paces for the mileage so I don't get too excited. Nike Run Club did set target paces. However, they were incredibly slow and did not noticeably adjust based off of the "benchmark" run (at least in the six weeks of use).

| Day | Distance       | Pace   |
| --- | -------------- | ------ |
| M   | 4 mi           | 8'20"  |
| T   | 4 x 800m       | 6'23"  |
| W   | rest           |        |
| Th  | 4 mi           | 10'16" |
| F   | rest           |        |
| Sa  | 8 mi           | 9'03"  |
| Su  | cross-training |        |

Also, I'm going to start using the conservative NY marathon plan rather than the NRC app plan. On Monday, the app on the watch routinely got the pace wrong by wild amounts, often showing around 10'00" randomly. A friend who ran the NYC marathon recommended the [plan (see middle of page)](https://www.nyrr.org/Races/2020TCSNewYorkCityMarathon/Training).

## Some Small Wins

Yet I did accomplish some goals set last week. For instance, hip strengthening every day has been helpful and even challenging.

- [x] Hip Strengthening Perfect Week

| Day | Dynamic Stretching | Foam Roll | Hip Strengthening |
| --- | ------------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| M   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| T   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| W   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| Th  | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| F   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| Sa  | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| Su  | ✅                 | ❌        | ✅                |

Nonetheless, I missed all of my goals, including the NTC workout. The new exercises were fun.

- [ ] Try one new exercise each day -> tried new exercises on three days from a friend [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP6NqiJ5hqM)
- [ ] Finish the scheduled nike training club workout (tbd today hehe)

## Pre-workout before run

As you can see, on Tuesday, that was a rough one. I learned to not have too much pre-workout before a run. My stomach was in agony during that one. I did not want to finish; yet I essentially crawled home haha.
