Enjoyed another week of running. Felt surprisingly good after 10 miles on Saturday. Missed out of on strengthening and stretching again. Hope to focus on that in next two weeks.

That's because I will need to quarantine for two weeks after returning from Wisconsin, a state on the [Chicago list](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/emergency-travel-order.html)

It will be a test to quarantine -- not just shelter-in-place -- for two weeks. I think running on this road has been worth it.
