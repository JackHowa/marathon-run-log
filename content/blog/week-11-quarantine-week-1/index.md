# Quarantine Week 1 After Travel

I was hesitant to continue posting about running considering the quarantine and travel order. However, again, it feels somehow more real if you write it.

So, I focused on stretching, foam rolling, and strengthening while staying in our apartment. It was helpful to have something to focus on every day with even more time inside the apartment, without running. It makes you realize how much a routine exercise can become.

The apartment felt a lot smaller and more bare compared with the family lakehouse.

| Day | Dynamic Stretching | Foam Roll | Hip Strengthening |
| --- | ------------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| M   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| T   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| W   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| Th  | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| F   | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| Sa  | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |
| Su  | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅                |

In any case, I'm lucky that I can quarantine like this. It was interesting how quarantining seems completely foreign, especially when you don't feel sick.

My legs and lower back feel sore from running on the beach on Sunday from Monday until Wednesday. I forgot how much of different muscles running on the beach barefoot can really be.

In terms of other workouts, I did Run Ready Flow (yoga for runners) on Tuesday and Kickboxing Basics on Sunday, through Nike Training Club. The app felt really welcoming, especially in quarantine. I wish that I had used it more during the week.
