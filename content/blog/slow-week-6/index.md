## Too Much Flexibility In Running Schedule

Long run felt good. Perhaps with less knee pain, I have less motivation to do hip strengthening. Will work on some of the strengthening exercises next week.

Amid a holiday weekend, the timing was a bit off. I would not normally do 9 miles on a workday.

| Day | Distance | Pace  |
| --- | -------- | ----- |
| M   | 4.5 mi   | 9'19" |
| T   | rest     |       |
| W   | 3 x 800m | 7'44" |
| Th  | 4 x 400m | 6'45" |
| F   | 9 mi     | 9'41" |
| Sa  | rest     |       |
| Su  | rest     |       |
